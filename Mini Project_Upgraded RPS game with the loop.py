Mini Project: Upgrade the RPS game with the following items:
1- It plays until one of the players (computer or human) wins 3 times. 
   That means the winning score is 3
2- It prints the total scores that computer and player has gained every time that 
   the loop iterates
3- Use the sample messages that I have shown in the following print screens. 
   To make your game playable.
4- if player types "quit" or "q" it exits the game.
5- If the human wins it prints "CONGRATS, YOU WON!", if computer wins it prints: 
    "OH NO :-( THE COMPUTER WON..." and if they tie, it prints â€œNO WINNER, IT'S A TIE"
